WHY ASTRO MAY BE FASTER THAN PYTHON
Python does type checking for many basic operations. Astro leverages type inference and avoids type checking for evident primitive operations.

Python uses switch-case opcode dispatch. Astro uses jump tables.

Python represents a list as arrays of pointers to objects. Astro uses a single pointer to contigous memory.

WHY ASTRO MAY BE SLOWER THAN PYTHON
Python function is simple and direct. However, due to covariance and multiple dispatch support in Astro, there may be excessive type checks at runtime.

I just solved some of the problems by introducing context switches.
