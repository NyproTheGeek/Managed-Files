STATIC ANALYSIS
- Determining a statically-sized array that has no chance of changing at runtime.
- Array index verification, where the index is not an expression.
- Verification of fields and methods for bound variables.
- Verification of fields and methods for flexible variables where the methods and fields are not inside branching statements. (Look at Crystallang's Union Types).
- Type inference for bound variables.
- Type inference for flexible variables that are not inside branching statements. (Look at Crystal-lang's Union Types).
- Identifying scope.
- Identifying passage of variable and the type of passage.


META TREES
- General Scope Tree
- Inheritance Scope Tree
- Function Dispatch List
- Event Trees
- Call Interface Lists
