Major Change:
    Restructuring for Multiple Dispatch
    Import is now module-based, rather than being type-based, due to the introduction of multiple dispatch
    A type's method may be defined outside the type's file
    Added def to function declaration #18/08/16
    Changing assignment operator back to good ol' way, binding to nil-and-one-other-type is still enforced 19/08/16
    The block punstuation is now $, it helps resolve some ambiguity in statements like repeat play() | while state == "Play" | x == y ? y | z
        repeat: play() $ while state == "Play" | x == y ? y $ z
    Added mut for mutable variable declaration; solves some scoping issues

PLUTO's DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
- let it do more with less
- make it fast
- make it legible
- make it consistent
- make it flexible. Dynamic and statically typed
- make it lightweight

DESCRIPTION
Pluto is a compiled/interpreted language that supports optional typing without sacrificing performance as a result.
Pluto is completely object-oriented and procedural at the same time. This is in part achieved by closely associating types with multiple dispatch in functions.
Some of Pluto's features include list comprehenshion, generics, closure, lambdas, mutiple dispatch

SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS
   # Hello


MULTILINE COMMENTS
    #=
    I'm Pluto
    I'm cool
    =#
    # Pluto's will support nested multiline comments :)


DOCUMENTATION
   # <code> Car </code>  class is deprecated # xml
   # [ code: 'Car' ] class is deprecated # deplu


VARIABLE DECLARATION & INITIALIZATION
    # Unlike Python, Pluto requires explicit variable declaration before usage
    mut x # is a mutable
    let y # is a constant
    def add(a, b): rt a + b # function parameters are implicitly mutable
    def swap!(mut a, mut b): a, b = b, a # error! mut should not be specified in their declaration
    mut e ; e = Car('Camaro') # semi-colon is used to separate two statements
    mut y = 12f
    mut z = 'Hello'
    mut a = Car('Camaro')
    mut b = Car('Camaro').setDate(2014) # ok
    mut n = getCar('Camaro')
    mut o = add(2, 4)
    mut p = List<Car>(3) # generics
    def add (a b c = UInt) Int
    def add (a = 1, b = 2, c = UInt(3)) UInt


SPECIFYING TYPES
    # type specification in declaration is used to specify what types a variable can be bind to
    mut p = Person # Person and Person's subtypes
    mut p =: Person # Person
    mut p <: Person # Person's subtypes
    mut p >: Person # Person's supertypes


VARIABLES AND REFERENCES
    # Value types such as Int, FLoat, et. are passed around by value, reference and container types are passed
    # aroud by reference
    # see pass table below
    mut pet = own getObject() # pet now holds a sole strong ref to the object returned
    mut pet = iso getObject() # pet exclusively exclusively refers to the object returned (if it is a value object)
    let put = val pet # assigned by value
    mut pot = read pat # read is a type of ref that allow reading only from referenced object
    # side effect of read:
    # if later in the future a variable is changed to read, it will lead to having to change code that have assigned to it, which can be a lot. :'(
    let pit = val put

    def subtract(let a let b let c = ref):
        c = a - b
        rt ref c
    ..
    mut dean = val subtract(x, y) # gets a copy
    let cop = subtract(x, y) # gets a ref

    def add(a b = ref):
        rt val a + b
    let alm = ref add(val x, val y) # warning, return a val to a ref

    swap!(val a, val b)
    # there is othing like ref iso or ref own, there is however val iso and val own.
    mut x = ref iso getName() # error!
    mut y = val own getName() # ok, y gets a copy of name and owns it.


OPTIONAL TYPE DECLARATION
   mut myNumber = Str|Int
   mut myNumber = '01000999'
   # might change the behavior below in the future
   mut myNumber = 23 # error! variable already bound to String

ARRAYS / LISTS
   # major diff between lists and arrays is that, the type and size of an array are
   # inferrable at compile time, this allows for arrays to be stored like traditional array

---------------! NOTES !------------------------
VARIABLE BINDING
- By default variables bind to one type and its subtypes. However depending on assignment operator used
- the behaviour can be changed.
    mut pat = Integer
    pat = 25i16
    pat = 750i32 # ok
    pat = "Hello" # error! dat can only be bound to Integer and its subtypes
    mut dat =: Integer
    dat = Int16(25) # error! dat can only be bound to Integer


LITERALS
- Literals are subexpressions that do not return unlike other subexpressions (variable access)
- or expressions (operations, function call).
Type of Literals
- Numeric
    50, 12_000_i32, 78.89e-2
- String
    "Hello", 'Hi'
- Symbol
    {Root}, {Parent {Child1, Child2}}


NIL
- Nil is a universal literal. Every type has a nil literal. This means, unlike most langs, all Pluto's
- types are nullable. The programmer doesn't need to specify which variable gets to be nullable.
- You can't return a nil value to an variable without handling it. Doing so will invoke NilErr.
    mut deal = nil
    mut done = deal # error! NilErr
    mut deck = deal?? # deck now accepts nil
    # you could also handle
    mut dark = deal?? 0  # dark will be 0 if deal == nil
- However, you can assign a nil literal directly to a variable without any sideffect. Literals do not return.
    mut brain = nil
    mut herat = nil


OBJECT HIERARCHY
- Any -> Indie, Array, Func
- Array -> Dict, Tuple


CONCURRENCY (Still Needs Proper Review)
- All singular +() and associative +=!() operations on variables are atomic by default.
- In an assignment or initialisation operation. The whole expression is singularly atomic
- Variables are volatile by default
- And methods are sychronised by default


CONDITIONALS
- Value
- nil or not
- True or false
- Type (===)


ITERABLES
- Coroutines
- Functions
- Range
- Array objects
- Table objects
- Iterable SubClasses
- String
- Enums


SUBJECT OF OPERATIONS
# is signified by '_'
- Stack
- Match
- Properties


AUTOMATIC REFERENCE COUNTING
- There can only be one strong ref to an object
    type Skeleton:
        bones List<own Bone> # bones contain a list of strong Refs to Bone objects
    ..
    type Bone:
        skel Skeleton
    ..


MOVE SEMANTICS
- Move feature is automatic in areas where it makes sense to do so for example, returning a value (not reference) to a variable.
- I removed the explicit move keyword cause I think it will have some unwanted side effects. For example, moving a returned reference which is also referenced elsewhere.
- And Pluto moves at the appropriate places anyway.



DECLARATIVE PLUTO ".deplu" #27/06/16
   person:[
      name : "Nypro"
      fat : false
      tall : true
      hobby : 'programming'
      single : _ # underscore as a value signifies empty
      children : [2, 3, 4, 6]
      coord : [x : 5]

      ]
   ]


DUCK TYPING EXAMPLES
   mut c
   mut a = 25
   mut b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # array
   mut c = [1, 2, 3 | 4, 5, 6] # multi dimen array
   mut d = ['Hello', 25, 1.3f, 'Hi'] # table
   def getArea(length, breadth):
      length * breadth
   ..
   mut length = 10
   mut breadth = 25
   mut rectangleArea = getArea(length, breadth)


NESTED ASSIGNMENT
- Pluto does not support nested assignments.
   mut tip = 5
   mut tap = (tip *= 5)

    Built-in Ind Types /  Value Types   |   val
    Array Types                         |   ref
    Func Types                          |   ref

=#
- Note that objects of relatively small Array, Func and Custom Types
- will be allocated on the stack while simulating referencing
- And this is done only if the object is iso or guaranteed to have a
- single reference


VARIABLE VS PARAMETER
- Variable declaration is nothing like parameter declaration


COMPILER WARNINGS
- When assigning to variables in other modules
- Pluto only warns when about imported naming ambiguities when the names are accessed


RUNTIME WARNINGS


COMPILATION
- '_' is compiled as a placeholder. This will be replaced at run time by a subject of operation
- some symbolic classes are evaluated at compile-time, e.g Func, MathExpr


PUNCTUATION
- Pluto needs proper use of indentations and newline to compile successfully
- This makes code reformatable to original when copied with newlines stripped.
- Pluto only supports 4-space identation


BIG AIMS
- If Pluto is written entirely statically, then most analyses should be done statically
- with benefits of optimisations (e.g. usingg traditional arrays). Only certain checks are
- done at runtime.
- Static ARC analysis. Be careful with concurrency.
